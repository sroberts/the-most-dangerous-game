# Threat Library
- [CRITs](https://crits.github.io/) is popular, [MISP](http://www.misp-project.org/) also
- Lighter solutions (like wikis) often work
- Market hasn't fully addressed this

# Web Monitoring Systems
- [Netflix Scumblr](https://github.com/Netflix/Scumblr) Meta Search (Works alongside Sketchy)
- [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/)
- Lots of custom development

# Malware Monitoring
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) is King
- Malware feeds with lots of custom internal solutions
- [Maltrieve](https://github.com/krmaxwell/maltrieve), [Viper](https://github.com/viper-framework/viper), & [Cuckoo](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org/)
- [Yara](https://plusvic.github.io/yara/) (We'll get to that...)

<short_description>DUQU (METHODOLOGY)</short_description>
<description>
Indicator for the duqu trojan. The initial duqu driver will decode and inject a dll (marked as .pnf) into a system process (usually services.exe). The injected dll contains another dll encoded within it's resource section which it will inject into other processes as identified within its encoded configuruation file (another .pnf file). This second injected dll is responsible for all backdoor/C2 communication.

## 11 URLs detected
## 1 email addresses detected
## 6 Web files detected

---

# Step 3: Secondary Sources
- Google to the rescue!
- Other vendor information (The "Me Too"s)
- Threat APIs
- Mailing lists
- Discuss with friends & colleagues

---

# Step 3: Enrich IOCs

--
- Use PassiveTotal passive DNS to get more IPs & URLs
- Gather current and historic whois data
- Use VirusTotal to find malware or related malware

???

- Fuzzy hashes are your friend

---

# Step 4: Build & Deploy Detection

--
- Snort signatures for network activity
- Yara rules for malware
- Basic blacklists
- Correlation rules & alerts
